# Agents Refresh

Rebuild project instruction artifacts from shared guidance while preserving project-specific rules.

## Shared Location

Shared baseline files live in the team's shared agents repository.

When refreshing another repository, resolve shared inputs from that configured location.

Required shared inputs:
- `<shared-agents>/instructions/COMMON.md`
- `<shared-agents>/instructions/`

## Goal

Produce a compact, project-targeted `AGENTS.md` for agents, while preserving project-local instructions and providing copied guidance docs that agents can read for full detail.

The rebuilt agents file should contain two main sections:
- `Project Specific Rules`
- `Standard Rules`

## Required Inputs

- target project repository
- target project's existing `AGENTS.md`
- shared `instructions/COMMON.md` and relevant files under `instructions/` (including subfolders such as `languages/`, `technologies/`, and `services/`)

## Rebuild Workflow

1. Load context
- Read the target project's existing `AGENTS.md`.
- Read shared common files and relevant instruction modules from the configured shared agents repository.
- Detect technologies in use from repo evidence (for example: `.swift`, `Package.swift`, `.xcodeproj`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`).

2. Preserve Project Specific Rules
- Retain project-specific policies, constraints, architecture notes, and workflows at the top of rebuilt `AGENTS.md`.
- Remove or rewrite only clearly obsolete or contradictory local instructions.

3. Rewrite Standard Rules
- Replace the rest of the file with compact agent guidance, based on `instructions/COMMON.md`.
- Always include core guidance from `instructions/COMMON.md` in rebuilt `AGENTS.md` (for example engineering principles, testing/validation expectations, safety, and source-quality rules).
- Add stack-relevant guidance from `instructions/` modules only when those languages/tools/services are used by the project.
- Prefer concrete, checkable instructions over narrative explanation.
- Ensure compact instructions preserve enough context for an agent to locate and load full detail from referenced local guidance files.
- When copied guidance files exist in the target repo, explicitly direct agents to read relevant files under `Extras/Documentation/Guidelines/`.
- Exclude unrelated language/framework/service modules.
- You may compress guidance for agent ingestion, but must preserve intent and principles.
- Do not weaken mandatory baseline requirements with hedging language (for example: `when practical`, `where feasible`, `if possible`) unless the baseline itself includes such qualifiers.

4. Add regeneration note
- At the bottom of `AGENTS.md`, add this exact note: `To refresh this file, use the refresh-agents skill.`

5. Copy relevant guideline files
- Copy relevant files from `instructions/` into `Extras/Documentation/Guidelines/`.
- Include core cross-cutting modules by default (`Principles.md`, `Testing.md`, `Trusted Sources.md`, `Good Code.md`), then add only relevant language/technology/service modules.
- Overwrite only managed copied files.
- Avoid touching project-authored docs outside the managed set.
- In each section of the new `AGENTS.md`, add links to local copies of relevant guidance files.
- Treat copied files as agent-first references that capture full required guidance; they are not just human companion docs.

6. Optionally regenerate a companion notes file
- Create or update `Extras/Documentation/Guidelines/Agent-Guidance-Notes.md` with:
- regenerated files
- included and excluded modules
- detected stack assumptions
- unresolved local-vs-shared instruction conflicts

7. Verify mandatory baseline clauses
- After drafting `AGENTS.md`, verify that mandatory baseline clauses from `instructions/COMMON.md` are still present in `Standard Rules` with equivalent force.
- Required clauses (semantic equivalent wording allowed):
  - testing: red/green TDD for non-UI code
  - UI testing expectation: create previews for UI code
  - validation discipline: follow testing/validation workflow and report skipped checks
  - safety: do not perform destructive actions without explicit approval
  - safety: if unexpected workspace changes appear, pause and confirm direction
  - source quality: prefer trusted primary sources for technical decisions
- If any required clause is intentionally omitted, record it in notes with a rationale.

8. Run a hedging-language lint on Standard Rules
- Check for requirement-softening terms in mandatory clauses, including:
  - `when practical`
  - `where feasible`
  - `if possible`
  - `try to`
  - `ideally`
- Remove or rewrite hedged phrasing unless the source baseline explicitly uses it.

9. Produce a baseline verification summary
- In either the companion notes file or the final response, include a short matrix:
  - required clause
  - status (`kept`, `rewritten-equivalent`, `omitted-intentional`)
  - location in rebuilt `AGENTS.md`

## Selection Rules

- Treat `instructions/COMMON.md` as mandatory baseline guidance for every refresh.
- Treat `instructions/` files as detailed, context-specific guidance.
- Include non-specific principles in final `AGENTS.md` even when compacting text.
- Prefer root-level instruction modules (`Principles.md`, `Testing.md`, `Trusted Sources.md`, `Good Code.md`) as the default copied set for agent consumption.
- Include language modules only when that language is present.
- Include technology/service modules only when actively used.
- If uncertain, preserve shared principles in `AGENTS.md` and move optional detail to copied agent-readable docs.
- Preserve mandatory baseline obligations explicitly; compacting must not reduce requirement strength.
- Prefer one-way tightening over weakening: clarify or make rules stricter when needed, but do not silently relax shared requirements.

## Output Checklist

In the final response, always include:

- Files changed
- Modules included and excluded
- Evidence used for stack detection
- What was copied into guideline docs
- Any unresolved local-vs-shared instruction conflicts
- Mandatory baseline clause verification results
- Any intentionally omitted baseline clauses with rationale
